# @0gflow/storage

Read and write 0G Flow execution traces on 0G Storage.

Uploads are serialised on purpose: one signer means one nonce sequence, and
concurrent uploads race it. A duplicate upload is treated as success, because
roots are deterministic and re-running a flow with identical inputs legitimately
collides with an earlier one — the data is already retrievable, which is all a
trace root claims.

## Where this fits

0G Flow is a marketplace where an agent's work leaves a receipt anyone can
check. Browse it at [https://explorer-production-25c8.up.railway.app](https://explorer-production-25c8.up.railway.app).
